# FeedTape - Project Context Document

## üéØ Product Vision

FeedTape is a mobile app that converts RSS feed articles into high-quality audio using text-to-speech, enabling users to listen to their favorite blogs while commuting, exercising, or doing other activities. Think of it as "podcasts for written content."

### Core Value Proposition
- **Transform any RSS feed into a personal podcast**
- **Listen to articles instead of reading them**
- **Premium voice quality using neural TTS**
- **Dead-simple user experience**

### Target Users
- Commuters who want to consume content while driving
- People who prefer audio learning
- Multitaskers who want to stay informed while doing other activities
- Non-native speakers who find listening easier than reading

## üì± Product Features

### MVP Features (Current Focus)
1. **RSS Feed Management** - Add/remove RSS feed URLs
2. **Audio Playback** - Convert articles to speech and play them
3. **Voice Selection** - Choose from multiple Spanish voices (Lucia, Sergio, Mia, Andr√©s)
4. **Playback Controls** - Play, pause, skip, speed adjustment
5. **Free Tier** - 20 minutes of audio per day
6. **Pro Tier** - Unlimited audio, higher quality voices

### Future Features (Post-MVP)
- Background playback and downloads
- Cross-device sync
- Smart playlists and auto-play
- AI-powered summaries
- Multiple language support
- Social features (share audio clips)

## üõ† Technical Stack

### Mobile App
- **Framework**: React Native + Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Local state + AsyncStorage
- **Audio Player**: expo-av
- **RSS Parsing**: Local XML parsing
- **Platform**: iOS first, Android later

### Backend API
- **Language**: Rust
- **Framework**: Axum web framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Railway.app ($5/month)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 (Apple/Google/GitHub) + JWT
- **TTS Service**: Amazon Polly (via AWS SDK)

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Railway (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **SSL**: Provided by Railway
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks
- **Logging**: Structured logging to stdout

## üèó Architecture Decisions

### 1. Frontend RSS Fetching vs Backend Fetching
**Decision**: Frontend fetching
**Why**:
- Native mobile apps don't have CORS restrictions
- Simpler backend (10x less code)
- Privacy-first (reading habits stay on device)
- Lower server costs
- Can always add backend fetching later

**Trade-offs**:
- Slower initial app load (2-3 seconds to fetch feeds)
- No push notifications for new articles
- No cross-device article sync
- Each user converts same articles separately

### 2. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: OAuth2-only (no passwords)
**Why**:
- No password management complexity
- Users trust Apple/Google more
- Faster onboarding
- Industry standard

**Implementation**:
- OAuth providers: Apple, Google, GitHub
- JWT tokens (1 hour) + refresh tokens (30 days)
- Stateless authentication

### 3. TTS Architecture
**Decision**: Backend proxy to Amazon Polly
**Why**:
- Secure (AWS credentials never exposed)
- Usage tracking and limits enforcement
- Potential for caching popular content
- Single point for optimization

**Alternative considered**: Direct Polly access from app
**Rejected because**: Security risk, no usage control

### 4. API Design
**Decision**: Minimal REST API with simplified endpoints
**Why**:
- Faster to implement (days vs weeks)
- Easier to maintain
- Clear separation of concerns

**Endpoints**:
- `/api/me` - User info, settings, subscription (single endpoint)
- `/api/feeds` - CRUD for feed URLs
- `/api/tts/synthesize` - Text to speech conversion
- Auth endpoints for OAuth flow

### 5. Monetization Strategy
**Decision**: Freemium with hard limits
**Tiers**:
- **Free**: 20 minutes/day, 3 feeds
- **Pro**: Unlimited audio, unlimited feeds

**Why**:
- Sustainable unit economics
- Clear value proposition for upgrade
- Generous enough free tier to hook users

### 6. Technology Choices

#### Why Rust for Backend?
- 10x lower memory usage than Node.js
- Can handle 1000+ users on $5/month server
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Excellent async performance
- Great PostgreSQL integration

#### Why Railway for Hosting?
- Zero DevOps required
- PostgreSQL included
- Automatic SSL certificates
- GitHub auto-deploy
- Cheaper than Heroku, simpler than AWS

#### Why Amazon Polly for TTS?
- Best Spanish neural voices (Lucia, Sergio)
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Fast generation (<500ms)
- Reliable API
- Wide language support for future

#### Why React Native + Expo?
- Single codebase for iOS/Android
- Fast development cycle
- Great audio libraries
- Native performance where needed
- Easy app store deployment

## üìä Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
- TTS latency: < 1 second to first audio byte
- API response time: < 200ms
- Feed parsing: < 100ms per feed
- App launch to playable: < 3 seconds

### Scalability Plan
- **Phase 1** (0-100 users): Single Railway instance
- **Phase 2** (100-1000 users): Add Redis caching
- **Phase 3** (1000+ users): Multiple instances + CDN

### Security Measures
- JWT tokens with short expiry
- Rate limiting per user
- Input sanitization
- HTTPS only
- AWS credentials only on backend

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Per User Economics (Monthly)
**Free User**:
- Polly API: ~‚Ç¨0.50 (limited usage)
- Hosting allocation: ~‚Ç¨0.05
- Net: -‚Ç¨0.55

**Pro User**:
- Revenue: ‚Ç¨4.99
- Polly API: ~‚Ç¨2.00 (heavy usage)
- Hosting allocation: ~‚Ç¨0.10
- Net: +‚Ç¨2.89

**Break-even**: ~17% conversion rate

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **100 users**: ‚Ç¨5 (Railway) + ‚Ç¨10 (Polly) = ‚Ç¨15
- **1000 users**: ‚Ç¨10 (Railway) + ‚Ç¨50 (Polly) = ‚Ç¨60
- **10000 users**: ‚Ç¨50 (Railway + Redis) + ‚Ç¨400 (Polly) = ‚Ç¨450

- [ ] B2B offerings

## üìù Key Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - Every feature must be obvious to use
2. **Privacy-Focused** - User data stays on device when possible
3. **Performance** - Audio should start playing within 1 second
4. **Reliability** - Offline mode is a first-class citizen
5. **Sustainability** - Unit economics must work at scale

## üéì Lessons Learned

### From Tech Spikes
- iOS native TTS works but has quality limitations
- Amazon Polly provides superior voice quality
- CORS is not an issue for native mobile apps
- Users need audio to work in silent mode
- Simple UI beats feature-rich UI

### Architecture Insights
- Frontend fetching dramatically simplifies the backend
- OAuth-only authentication removes entire categories of problems
- Hard usage limits are essential for freemium models
- Rust backend can handle surprising load on minimal hardware

## üîÑ Decisions to Revisit Later

1. **Backend feed fetching** - Add when users want push notifications
2. **Audio caching** - Implement when same articles are converted repeatedly
3. **Cross-device sync** - Add as premium feature
4. **WebSocket for real-time** - Only if adding collaborative features
5. **Microservices** - Stay monolithic until 10,000+ users
