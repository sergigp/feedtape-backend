# Feature Specification: Feed Suggestions by Category

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a new endpoint to suggest a list of hardcoded feeds suggestions by category. The use case we want to solve with this is when a new user registers his list of feeds is empty. We will ask him in what categories is he interested and based on that the app will show some feed suggestions."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Onboarding with Category Selection (Priority: P1)

A new user who just registered sees an empty feed list. The app presents a list of categories to choose from. The user selects one or more categories they're interested in (e.g., Technology, News, Sports), and the system displays a curated list of popular RSS feeds in those categories. The user can then add any of these suggested feeds to their personal feed list with a single action.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality that solves the empty state problem for new users. Without this, new users have no guidance on what feeds to add and may abandon the app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new user account, selecting categories, and verifying that relevant feed suggestions appear. Delivers immediate value by helping users populate their feed list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a newly registered user with zero feeds, **When** they access their feed list, **Then** they should be prompted to select categories of interest
2. **Given** the user is viewing available categories, **When** they select one or more categories (e.g., "Technology" and "News"), **Then** the system displays feed suggestions for those categories
3. **Given** the user sees feed suggestions, **When** they choose to add a suggested feed, **Then** that feed is added to their personal feed list
4. **Given** the user has selected categories, **When** they view suggestions for a specific category, **Then** they see 4 curated feed suggestions per category

### User Story 2 - Browse All Available Categories (Priority: P2)

A user (new or existing) wants to explore what categories are available before making a selection. They can view a complete list of all available categories with descriptions to help them understand what type of content each category offers.

**Why this priority**: Helps users make informed choices about which categories to explore. Important for discoverability but not blocking for the core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling the endpoint to retrieve all available categories and verifying the response includes category names and descriptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any authenticated user, **When** they request the list of available categories, **Then** they receive all categories with names and descriptions
2. **Given** the list of categories, **When** the user views them, **Then** categories are presented in a logical order (alphabetical or by popularity)

### User Story 3 - Refresh Feed Suggestions (Priority: P3)

An existing user who wants to discover new content can browse feed suggestions even after initial onboarding. They can select different categories or revisit previously selected categories to see if new suggestions have been added.

**Why this priority**: Provides ongoing value for user engagement and content discovery. Nice to have but not critical for initial launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by an existing user with feeds already in their list accessing the suggestions endpoint and verifying they can still browse and add new feeds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing user with feeds already added, **When** they access feed suggestions, **Then** they can browse suggestions without being forced through onboarding again
2. **Given** a user browsing suggestions, **When** they select a category they've previously explored, **Then** they see the same curated list of feeds for that category

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user selects a category that has no feed suggestions?
- What happens when a user tries to add a suggested feed that's already in their feed list?
- How does the system handle requests for invalid or non-existent category identifiers?
- What happens if the hardcoded feed list is empty for a valid category?
- How does the system respond when an unauthenticated user tries to access feed suggestions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an endpoint to retrieve all available feed categories
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an endpoint to retrieve feed suggestions filtered by one or more category identifiers
- **FR-003**: System MUST return feed suggestions that include feed title, description, RSS URL, and category information
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a curated list of feed suggestions organized by category
- **FR-005**: System MUST return exactly 4 feed suggestions per category when that category is requested
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple categories being requested in a single query (e.g., "show me Technology and News feeds")
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate feeds from appearing when multiple categories are selected that share the same feed
- **FR-008**: System MUST require authentication to access feed suggestions endpoints
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that requested category identifiers exist before returning suggestions
- **FR-010**: System MUST return appropriate error messages when invalid categories are requested
- **FR-011**: System MUST support exactly 20 categories: News & Current Affairs, Technology & Programming, Science & Research, Business & Finance, Design & Creativity, Gaming & Entertainment, Health & Fitness, Food & Cooking, Travel & Adventure, Books & Literature, Movies & TV, Music & Podcasts, Sports, Environment & Sustainability, Politics & Policy, Personal Development, Lifestyle & Home, Automotive, Fashion & Beauty, and Education & Learning
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide exactly 4 curated feed suggestions per category (80 total feeds)
- **FR-013**: Feed suggestions MUST include verified RSS feed URLs that have been pre-validated

### Key Entities

- **Category**: Represents a content category (e.g., Technology, News, Sports). Contains a unique identifier, display name, and description.
- **Feed Suggestion**: Represents a curated RSS feed recommendation. Contains feed title, description, RSS feed URL, category associations, and optionally a popularity or quality indicator.

### Assumptions

- Feed suggestions are hardcoded/static and do not change based on user behavior or analytics
- The same feed can belong to multiple categories (e.g., "TechCrunch" could be in both Technology and Business)
- All users see the same feed suggestions for a given category (no personalization in MVP)
- Feed URLs are pre-validated and known to be working RSS feeds
- Categories are fixed and do not support user-created categories
- The onboarding flow UI will be handled by the mobile app; the backend only provides the data endpoints

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New users can discover and add their first feed within 60 seconds of registration
- **SC-002**: At least 80% of new users add at least one suggested feed during onboarding
- **SC-003**: Feed suggestion endpoints respond in under 500 milliseconds for typical queries
- **SC-004**: Users can successfully retrieve feed suggestions for any supported category without errors
- **SC-005**: The feature reduces new user abandonment rate by providing immediate content discovery
